**CoVideo News.TV – Projekttheater Hall in Tirol, directed by Kurt Benkovic, written by Sarah Milena Rendel**

October 2021

The young Tyrolean author Sarah Milena Rendel (born in 1992) dealt with the impact of the pandemic on private news television in 2020. As a result, she wrote a comedy that illuminates the gender roles of both men and women in this work field. The transmission of news in permanent live broadcasts offers quite a few surprises and due to the isolation to the world, lots of intrigues can be spun in order to rise up the career ladder.

**Maria.Königin – Projekttheater Hall in Tirol, directed by Kurt Benkovic written by Lina Hofstädter**

October - November – December 2019

Due to the #metoo debate in 2018, the Tyrolean author Lina Hofstädter dealt with the life of Maria Stuart. She focused on the Scottish Queen’s younger years - starting from where Maria becomes queen of France at the age of 17. After her Husband’s death, she returns to Scotland and reigns there until she has to flee to England at the age of 26. In the 16th century, Scotland and England were both ruled by women. Folks and nobility considered this as a violation to the natural order – where the man is the crown of creation and head of the family. A woman must submit to his will.

The author illustrates the principle of the patriarchal society at that time and allows us to draw parallels to our today’s world.

„**Wias kimm’t“ – Bogentheater Innsbruck, directed by Katharina Schwaiger, written by Stephanie Larcher-Senn**

October-November 2018

In the early 1960s, a boy and a girl fall in love with each other. As a result, she gets unexpectedly pregnant. But back then, having a child as an unmarried couple was a sin. The girl’s strict mother insists on a quick wedding, preferably before the child gets born. The young couple tries, therefore, to fix a wedding date with the local pastor – which turns out to be more difficult than expected.

**Allegory of pain for the opening of the vernissage “SENS IT (L) IVE”, by Lisa Wöss**

October 2017

Location: DIE BÄCKEREI, Innsbruck

Viktoria staged the pain and the birth of art

*<https://www.liz-aw-visualization.com/exhibitions-references/2017-sens-it-l-ive/>*

PERFORMANCE TEXT (OPENING TEXT) 

Pictures, consisting of lines, dots, forms which are sums of points. Of wound points. Of pain points. 

Art is born in pain. Birth is pain. 

Opening the eyes of this body you live in for this world facing gravity is pain. 

Pain leads to opened eyes, to opened senses if you do not try to avoid it because you interpret fear in a wrong way. Fear is the Signal of pain. 

If we could avoid gravity, we would. So we try to avoid pain, which is impossible when it comes to life.

Pain is the inverse vector of gravity, conjunction, the spin of life.

Solving the everything into the nothing, binding the nothing into the everything in every direction and the other way around. A round melting to origin.

If the smallest we can visualize is a point, then the point could widen into a circle. 

Both have no beginning and no end. Beginning and end are human creations out of fear, interpreting this signal in a blind way by not looking at it. Stop trying to value or devalue feelings for not having to stop anymore, for being able to grow, for being in the flow. Imagine all minds as points in a waving picture, always changing their form. 

Pain is a feeling, feelings are the only things that are real, for sure. Surreal surrounding point of view in a picture that can be visualized, seen, sensed and felt. Feelings are the constant of human beings, the connection in the solvation. 

Pain gives birth. Birth gives pain. The imagination of beginning and end has been dissolved by sensing the picture of gravity and pain.

„**Frau Suitner“ – Haller Burgsommer, directed by Elmar Drexel, written by Karl Schönherr**

June 2016

Frau Suitner is an elderly lady who feels unworthy because she had never given birth to a child. Despite the fact that she managed to afford a debt-free life through hard work, she feels guilty and sorry for herself and her husband. Despite her tremendous jealousy, she takes the decision to drive him towards a girlish young woman - so at least he can have his own family.

Viktoria played the doctor’s secretary, at the side of Brigitte Jaufenthaler, Ronja Forcher and the ensemble “Theaterhaufen Hall”.
