  title: "Productions„Wias kimm’t“ – Bogentheater Innsbruck, directed by Katharina
    Schwaiger,  written by Stephanie Larcher-Senn October-November  2018  In the
    early 1960’s, a boy and a girl fall in love with each other. As a result,
    she gets unexpectedly pregnant. But back then having a child as an unmarried
    couple was a sin. The girl’s strict mother insists on a quick wedding,
    preferably before the child gets born. The young couple tries, therefore, to
    fix a wedding date with the local pastor – which  turns out to be more
    difficult as expected.   Cast:  The girl  Viktoria Castellano  The

June 2016

Frau Suitner is an elderly lady who feels unworthy because she had never given birth to a child. Despite the fact that she managed to afford a debt-free life through hard work, she feels guilty and sorry for herself and her husband. Despite her tremendous jealousy, she takes the decision to drive him towards a girlish young woman - so at least he can have his own family.

Viktoria played the doctor’s secretary, at the side of Brigitte Jaufenthaler, Ronja Forcher and the ensemble “Theaterhaufen Hall”.
